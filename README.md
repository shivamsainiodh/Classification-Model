# Classification-Model

Project: Classification

1. Introduction


This project is aimed at developing a model that predicts whether the client will
subscribe to particular service or not.
Using this model, the efficiency of this type of services can improve and it will
also save the time and effort of the organization.


2. Problem Statement:


Client is a retail banking institution. Term deposits are a major source of income
for a bank.
A term deposit is a cash investment held at a financial institution. Your money is
invested for an agreed rate of interest over a fixed amount of time, or term.
The bank has various outreach plans to sell term deposits to their customers such
as email marketing, advertisements, telephonic marketing and digital marketing.
Telephonic marketing campaigns still remain one of the most effective way to
reach out to people. However, they require huge investment as large call centers
are hired to actually execute these campaigns. Hence, it is crucial to identify the
customers most likely to convert beforehand so that they can be specifically
targeted via call.
Given all information about the client, task is to predict if the client will
subscribe to term deposit.

3.Data

You are provided with following files:

1. train.csv : Use this dataset to train the model. This file contains all the
client and call details as well as the target variable “subscribed”. You have
to train your model using this file.

2. test.csv : Use the trained model to predict whether a new set of clients
will subscribe the term deposit.

At last save the prediction in submission.csv.
